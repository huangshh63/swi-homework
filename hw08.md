## 1Program with machine language according to the following c.
int_8 a = 1;  
int_8 c = a + 3; 
### 1）Write your assembly code & machine code
 LOD # 1–>STO X –> LOD X –> ADD#3 –> STO Y –> HLT
### 2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
Main  Memory->Fetch Instruction->Decode instruction->Registers->Get data->Execute(执行) the instruction->Main Memory 
### 3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU
IR 指令寄存器  
PC 程序计数器
ACC 累加寄存器
### 4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine
## 2、简答题
### 1）What are stored in memory?
instruction and data
### 2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?
yes
### 3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
##Instruction Format
• There are two parts to an instruction  
– The 8-bit instruction specifier（命令指示）  
– And optionally, the 8-bit operand specifier（操作数）
0 0 0 X Z Z Z Z  instruction specifier： ZZZZ：操作码
X:寻址模式  
b b b b b b b b operand specifier： 一个数值，或者
一个内存地址 1表示操作数是数值 0表示操作数是该地址的内容
## 3、解释以下词汇
### 1）汇编语言（Assembly Language
An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
### 2）编译（Compiler）
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers
### 3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）
n computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
###  4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements
### 5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC.[1] Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
