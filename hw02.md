2)Positional notation:Positional notation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place"). This greatly simplified arithmetic, leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.![2](http://a2.qpic.cn/psb?/V12aKRuu4cvTlT/OhHK36Qa2oKJGKxCC2nJHT7EHQSBFNvf5IdouDkEgXg!/m/dEkBAAAAAAAA&bo=AANAAgAAAAADB2M!&rf=photolist)
